Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets. And the data came from @hammerData


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to enable a detailed analysis of grocery price trends across Canada, focusing specifically on organic products. It fills a gap in publicly available datasets by providing a structured format for analyzing price evolution and vendor-specific pricing strategies.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was assembled by Jacob Filipp as part of Project Hammer, an initiative dedicated to promoting competition and reducing collusion in Canada's grocery sector.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The creation of the dataset was independently funded, with no specific grants associated.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - This dataset serves as a valuable resource for examining market dynamics, pricing models, and economic behaviors within the Canadian grocery industry.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The dataset comprises records of grocery prices, including fields such as product id, product name, old price, current price, vendor, and date.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- It includes data from eight vendors: Voila, T&T, Loblaws, No Frills, Metro, Galleria, Walmart, and Save-On-Foods, covering dates from February 28, 2024, current time.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is designed to cover all available instances within a specified timeframe, providing a comprehensive view of the market during that period.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each entry contains raw price data, supplier details and time information, allowing analysis of price changes over time.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The primary target variable of interest is the 'current_price' of each product.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some price are missing becuase the data is not recorded. Any missing values were addressed through data cleaning and imputation processes to ensure completeness.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- The dataset explicitly captures relationships between old and current prices, as well as vendor-specific pricing strategies.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Not really. But for predictive modeling, a common approach is to split the data into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Potential errors from web scraping were mitigated through validation checks and data cleaning procedures.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is self-contained, with data sourced directly from publicly accessible grocery websites.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	-  The dataset does not include confidential information.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	-  The data is factual and does not contain offensive content.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Sub-populations are identified by vendor, facilitating analysis of different pricing strategies.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No individuals can be identified from the dataset.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset does not contain sensitive personal information.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- No

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- Data was collected through web scraping and API utilization from top grocers' websites.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- Automated scripts and available APIs were employed for data collection, with validation through cross-referencing and in-store price checks.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
