It is designed as a resource for understanding market trends and storytelling through data analysis, offering a foundation for further exploration.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Jacob Filippâ€™s groceries dataset. Because the nature of large dataset, the dataset csv file can be download at: https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, datasheet, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, test simulate, clean data, test analysis data, EDA and modelling. 


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of this project were developed with the assistance of the AI tool, ChatGPT. The abstract, introduction, result, discussion, datasheet, and appendix sections were written with the help of ChatGPT. Portions of the code were adapted from resources in Telling Stories with Data and written with the help of ChatGPT-4o. Additionally, the modelling, results, and data analysis were conducted using ChatGPT-4o. The entire chat history available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
